different style conventions),

## plugins

Vundle vs pathogen

I do.
Pathogen and Vundle are not the same thing: Pathogen could be called a "runtimepath manager" while Vundle is a "plugin manager". The difference is huge:
Pathogen's only purpose is to "inject" the directories located in ~/.vim/bundle into Vim's runtimepath and make sure the documentation for all those plugins is correctly indexed. How they end up there and whether they are up-to-date or not is not Pathogen's business.
Vundle, in addition to what Pathogen does, tries to deal with everything else plugin-related: installating, removing, disabling, updatingâ€¦
So both plugins serve different purposes and solve different problems.
I don't like to have my plugins scattered around my ~/.vim directory but I don't need any help for updating or installing them. That's not something I do often enough that I need a plugin to automatize it. Pathogen is all I need/want and it does its job perfectly.

## Misc

(although I know this is more about configuration than usage) the
:g// command, which I think most people don't know about.

## Too many pluginz!!

"Every time I read an article like this, it's how a power user installs an array of plugins and customizations to really soup up Vim, which to me kind of misses the point. If you want that level whiz-bang, use Coda or Sublime Text 2 or Eclipse or whatever." http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5245426

I've seen one too many love-letter-to-Vim blog posts where the author recommends a flashy plugin that does nothing to really improve productivity. You know what improves productivity? Mastering motions and operators.
