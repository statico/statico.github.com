Wow, what a response!

## Motion

There was a lot of noise about my remapping of the <kbd>;</kbd> key, and for good reason. The two camps of opinion were "Yeah, I never use that" and "What are you talking about? <kbd>;</kbd> is *essential*!". What does it do? From [motion.txt][semicolon]:

    ;     Repeat latest f, t, F or T [count] times.

Indeed, <kbd>;</kbd> *does* seem pretty useful. I occasionally have looped over a <kbd>t</kbd><kbd>x</kbd><kbd>n</kbd> sequence to move to subsequent `x`'s on a line, so <kbd>;</kbd> would make that a lot easier. I might just have to switch it from my beloved Ctrl-P buffer-switching key.

Speaking of motion, a plugin brought to my attention was [EasyMotion][easymotion], which gives you a visual way of moving around. The trick is to keep your eye on the location where you want to move (my leader key is <kbd>,</kbd>):

EasyMotion is certainly neat and I'll give it a try, but after so many years of using Vim's advanced movement keys, I'm sure that I'll never remember to use it. If I need to move to the second word three lines down it's a lot faster to remember <kbd>j</kbd><kbd>j</kbd><kbd>j</kbd><kbd>w</kbd><kbd>w</kbd> than to remember what incantation causes EasyMotion to appear. It would much more useful if a single key could bring up EasyMotion for all points of text on the screen -- the same way [Vimium plugin for Chrome][vimium] lets you navigate to links on a web page.

Someone also mentioned [vim-seek](https://github.com/goldfeld/vim-seek) which "aims to make inline navigation effortless," but I don't have time to learn of it, and nobody I know has smashed down my door to tell me how life-changing it is.

## Leaders

A bit of discussion involved [the leader key][leader]. The leader key is an arbitrary key which plugins use for keybindings so that they don't interfere with your own custom bindings. By default it's <kbd>\</kbd>, but a lot of people remap it to <kbd>,</kbd> for similar reasons as the semicolon.

{% highlight vim %}
let mapleader = ","
{% endhighlight %}

A handful of comments on Reddit and Hacker News mentioned changing it to the space bar which, unlike the <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd>, *really* doesn't do much in normal mode by default (it performs the motion as <kbd>l</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>).

{% highlight vim %}
let mapleader = "\<space>"
{% endhighlight %}

Note the required backslash.

It's also worth mentioning that some folks use folds so much that <kbd>Space</kbd> is bound to toggle folds:

{% highlight vim %}
nnoremap <space> za
nnoremap <CR> za
vnoremap <space> zf
{% endhighlight %}

I tried this but it never caught on. I always felt that <kbd>z</kbd><kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> were easier to remember.

Window navigation shortcuts:
    map <C-J> <C-W>j<C-W>_
    map <C-K> <C-W>k<C-W>_
    map <C-H> <C-W>h<C-W>_
    map <C-L> <C-W>l<C-W>_

## plugins

Vundle vs pathogen

I do.
Pathogen and Vundle are not the same thing: Pathogen could be called a "runtimepath manager" while Vundle is a "plugin manager". The difference is huge:
Pathogen's only purpose is to "inject" the directories located in ~/.vim/bundle into Vim's runtimepath and make sure the documentation for all those plugins is correctly indexed. How they end up there and whether they are up-to-date or not is not Pathogen's business.
Vundle, in addition to what Pathogen does, tries to deal with everything else plugin-related: installating, removing, disabling, updating…
So both plugins serve different purposes and solve different problems.
I don't like to have my plugins scattered around my ~/.vim directory but I don't need any help for updating or installing them. That's not something I do often enough that I need a plugin to automatize it. Pathogen is all I need/want and it does its job perfectly.

## Misc

(although I know this is more about configuration than usage) the
:g// command, which I think most people don't know about.

## Too many pluginz!!

"Every time I read an article like this, it's how a power user installs an array of plugins and customizations to really soup up Vim, which to me kind of misses the point. If you want that level whiz-bang, use Coda or Sublime Text 2 or Eclipse or whatever." http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5245426

I've seen one too many love-letter-to-Vim blog posts where the author recommends a flashy plugin that does nothing to really improve productivity. You know what improves productivity? Mastering motions and operators.
