title: "From Vim to VS Code After 17 Years"
description: Vim served as my primary text editor for almost two decades. But now, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code has progressed to being more functional and faster. I've switched and I haven't looked back. Mostly.

Over the last few years I've documented how I've used Vim (and MacVim) in my day-to-day use. A lot of people seemed to find those articles extremely useful and were overjoyed to see a "modern, recent" Vim setup. I'm glad to have created helpful, educational content to make people more productive.

However, after more than 17 years since adopting Vim as my primary productivity tool, I'm compelled to give that title to Microsoft's Visual Studio Code development environment. This wasn't an easy decision, and I had a few false starts prior to my full-time adoption last year. But VS Code has now progressed to the point where, if budding software engineers ask, "What editor should I use?" then my response will be VS Code.

TL;DR of why I've switched to VS Code:

* Vim emulation is good enough. ðŸ¤·
* Everything just works with zero to minimal configuration.
* It's absurdly fast, has a great UI, and is easily customizable.
* It works on macOS and Linux.
* The ability to fuzzy-search commands and configuration options is something no person should live without.



### Conclusion

I was discussing this topic on the Reactiflux Discord server, and a fellow community member decided to point out all the ways that Vim has the features I had described. "Just use `XXX-server`," I was told, "and then use `YYY` and `ZZZ` and you'll get all the best parts of VS Code type completion." So I installed those plugins, fired up Vim, and nothing worked. Because I still love Vim, I spent a good 15 minutes fully committed to _trying_ to make it work, but couldn't. This was in the middle of the day during a work day, so I had to stop and get back to work.

And, dear reader, that leads to one of my most powerful conclusions: I am being paid to get stuff done, not twiddle my text editor. Ten years ago I would have gladly spent half a day configuring Vim to work properly with all of the features I need. But I am no longer in a position where I can say, "Sorry, I didn't get that done because I was configuring my text editor."
